2. Sample programs on ML
https://github.com/codebasics/py

Program 1 -Linear regression
Program 2 - Single variate and multivariate
--
Program 8 -- Classification

Gradient descent  - 
y=x*x

build ml application

UI
create a model
Test model
fine tune model
convert into pickle file

load the pickle file to get back
model
create a web api


activation functions
sigmoid

3. Getting started with ML2
